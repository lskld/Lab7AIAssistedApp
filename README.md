# Lab 7 - AI Assisted App
This readme file is also fully AI generated. 

A .NET 8 console application for creating and managing RPG characters. This project was developed as a learning exercise in AI-assisted software development, demonstrating how to effectively use AI tools to support the development process while maintaining critical thinking and code ownership.

## üìã Project Purpose

This project was created as part of an assignment to practice using AI tools (specifically Claude Sonnet 4.5 via GitHub Copilot) in a conscious and critical way during software development. The goal was to:

- **Plan** the application structure with AI assistance
- **Request help** for design decisions and implementation details
- **Review** AI-generated suggestions critically before implementation
- **Use** AI as a support tool, not a replacement for understanding

### AI Assistance Used

The AI assisted with:
- Overall program structure and architecture
- Identifying which classes were needed (`Character`, `CharacterGenerator`, `DisplayHelper`)
- Suggesting appropriate methods for each class
- Code structure and best practices

**Important:** All AI-generated code was reviewed, understood, and adapted before being used in the project.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Create Characters**: Interactively create new characters with custom attributes
- **List Characters**: Display all created characters with their details
- **Simple Menu System**: Easy-to-use console interface
- **In-Memory Storage**: Characters are stored during runtime

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

- **Language**: C# 12.0
- **Framework**: .NET 8
- **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022
- **Architecture**: Object-oriented design with separation of concerns
